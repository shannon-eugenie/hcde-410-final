# HCDE 410: Human Data Interaction
Files for HCDE410 - Final

## Goal:
The analysis investigates the relationship between various lifestyle factors (smoking and exercise) and physical health indicators (blood pressure (systolic and diaslotic pressure), cholesterol levels, glucose levels, and height and weight (BMI)) with a focus on cardiovascular health. The main goal of this project is to identify correlations between these factors and the risk of heart attack and determine the main contributor leading to a higher risk of heart attack.
